Command descriptions

* The kill command sends signals to a process. That process can be specified
  By a pid or name. By default, kill sends the TERM signal, which terminates
  programs by default.

* kill -9 will signal all processes in group 9 with TERM unless another signal
  is specified

* pkill will search for and send signals to processes matching the criteria
  that is specified by the arguments

* top will bring up a menu of running processes and list their user, pid, cpu 
  usage, memory usage and the command that is running the process (and more).

* top -u `user` -d 0.5 will bring up processes only associated with 'user'.
  The -d 0.5 argument will make top refresh every 0.5 seconds.

* who | tr 'a' 'A' will translate the 'a' and 'A' characters from the output of 
  the who command to another character set. 

Command usage:
a) count all processes that are currently running on your system
The grep command filters out the first line.
ps -A | grep -v 'TTY' | wc -l 

b) send SIGINT to a process. SIGINT has the value of 2.
kill -s 2 pid

c) listing only hidden files in current directory.
Dang, you had me learn RegEx
ls -a | grep -e "^[.][a-zA-Z0-9_]"

2. If you press Ctrl-C when the program is waiting for a response to the 'do
   you want' to quit question, the characters '^C' appear in response to every 
   time you press Ctrl-C .

4. a) the various play again versions use different terminal settings and have 
      different methods of filtering text to just get 'y' or 'n'.
