The date command sets or prints the date and time. If the time was not specified on the command line, the date command just prints the date and time.

The who command shows how many and which users are logged into the system

Using whoami as a command prints your username.

Who am i prints your username and shows the time and date you logged in as well as the server/computer you logged into.

Using pwd prints the directory you are currently in.

The cd command navigates into another directory.

The mkdir command makes a new folder.

The rm command deletes a file (or folder if -rf is specified).

Using rmdir deletes an empty folder.

The cp command copies a file or folder from one location to another.

The mv command moves a file or folder from on location to another. It can also be used to rename a file or folder.

The ls command displays all files and folder in the current directory. If -l is used as a argument, then it displays the permissions and date modified and the file size and the username of the owner of the file. If the -g flag is used, then it displays all the information that ls -l does, but without showing the username of the file or folder's owner.

The cat command prints the contents of a file to the screen. The file can be specified as an argument on the command line.

The more command reads from a file and displays the text of that file on the screen one page at a time. The file to read from is given as a command line argument.

The less command performs the same function as the more command, but also allows the user to move backward as well as forward in the text displayed.
