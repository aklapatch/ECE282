Overall List: 
Error/Usage message if there are no args
create dest file if does not exist
error if source does not exist and exit
Append to dest file

append.c flow:
check for argc
    if argc <=2 ( source but no dest specified)
        print usage message and exit
    ( will not need to have a --help since no dest will be specified)


try to open source file
if source file does not exist
    print error + exit

otherwise
    append source to dest file
    account for errors along the way.

append.c functions:
    readFile: reads file and returns string with text in it. returns "NULL" if the filed does not open
    appendfile: takes in a string and appends that to the specified filename. prints error messages too.
